# StellarSpend Contracts

> Soroban smart contracts for automated budgets, savings goals, and private spending limit verification on Stellar.

**Stellar Hacks: Real-World ZK Submission** — We added zero-knowledge proof verification to spending limits. Users can prove a payment is within their limit without revealing the actual amount.
## Key Features

- Privacy-preserving spending limits
- UltraHonk proof verification
- Soroban smart contract integration
- Automated budget controls
- Savings goals
- Escrow services
- Open-source Stellar infrastructure
---

## Problem

When spending limits are enforced on Stellar, payment amounts are visible on-chain. Anyone can see them. For users in emerging markets handling sensitive financial data, this is a real privacy problem that reduces trust and adoption.

---

## Solution

We integrated zero-knowledge proofs into our spending limits contract.

> **Without a valid ZK proof, the spending authorization contract rejects the transaction. ZK is load-bearing — not decorative.**

Users generate a proof off-chain that cryptographically proves their payment is within their spending limit. The proof is verified by a Soroban smart contract on Stellar. The payment amount never appears on-chain.

## Proof Generation Example

The spending proof circuit successfully generates and verifies a zero-knowledge proof locally using Noir and Barretenberg.

![ZK Proof Verified](docs/images/zk_proof_verified.png)
## On-Chain Verification

The generated UltraHonk proof is submitted to the `zk-verifier`
Soroban contract.

The verifier contract validates the proof before the
`spending-limits` contract authorizes a payment.

Without successful verification, the transaction is rejected.

## How ZK Works

```
User wants to make a payment
          ↓
[Off-chain] Noir circuit generates ZK proof
  Private inputs: payment_amount, spending_limit
  Public output: proof (amount stays hidden)
          ↓
Proof submitted to Stellar testnet
          ↓
[On-chain] zk-verifier Soroban contract
  verifies the proof using UltraHonk
          ↓
spending-limits contract enforces decision
          ↓
  Approved ✅ or Rejected ❌
  (payment amount never revealed on-chain)
```

## How Stellar Is Used

- ZK proof is verified inside a **Soroban smart contract** deployed on Stellar
- The `zk-verifier` contract connects directly to the existing `spending-limits` contract
- All contract logic is written in Rust using the Soroban SDK
- Compatible with Stellar testnet and mainnet

## ZK Circuit

Located in `circuits/spending_proof/src/main.nr`

Written in **Noir** — a Rust-like ZK language.

```noir
fn main(payment_amount: u64, spending_limit: u64) {
    // Prove payment is positive
    assert(payment_amount > 0);

    // Prove payment is within limit — without revealing the amount
    assert(payment_amount <= spending_limit);
}
```

The circuit takes private inputs and generates an **UltraHonk proof** verified by Barretenberg.

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| Rust | Build contracts | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` |
| Nargo | Compile ZK circuits | `noirup` |
| Barretenberg (bb) | Generate and verify proofs | `bbup` |
| Soroban CLI | Deploy contracts | `cargo install --locked stellar-cli` |

### Step 1 — Install Nargo

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noir-lang/noirup/main/install | bash
source ~/.bashrc
noirup
```

### Step 2 — Install Barretenberg

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/master/barretenberg/bbup/install | bash
source ~/.bashrc
bbup
```

### Step 3 — Generate and Verify ZK Proof

```bash
cd circuits/spending_proof
bash ../../scripts/generate_proof.sh
```

Expected output:
```
=== Step 1: Generating witness ===
Circuit witness successfully solved

=== Step 2: Writing verification key ===
VK saved to ./target/vk/vk

=== Step 3: Generating ZK proof ===
Proof saved to ./target/proof/proof

=== Step 4: Verifying proof ===
Proof verified successfully
```

### Step 4 — Build All Contracts

```bash
cargo build
```

### Step 5 — Run Tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```
